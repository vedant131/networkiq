# 12 rules + AI-specific checks. Drop it in your project root. Ship securely every time.

AI tools can write code fast. But they do not care if your app is secure. The output looks right, it runs, and it gets shipped. The security holes follow quietly behind it.

This guide gives you a set of rules to drop into your project root as a CLAUDE.md or .cursorrules file. Every app generated in that project then has to follow them. No exceptions, no prompting it twice.

Thirteen categories. Every one of them covers a real-world vulnerability that AI-generated apps miss regularly. Work through each section, add the relevant checks to your stack, and use the quick reference table at the end before every deploy.


## 1. Secrets and Environment Variables

API keys hardcoded in frontend files are one of the most common ways apps get breached. AI tools do it all the time if you do not tell them otherwise. Set these rules once and forget about it.

**RULE**  Never expose secrets in frontend code

*   Every API key, token, database URL, and private config lives in `.env` files only.
*   `.env` files must always be listed in `.gitignore`. Generate a `.gitignore` that excludes `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.*.local`.
*   Frontend code must never contain raw secret values. No `const API_KEY = "sk-..."` in client-side files.
*   For Next.js or Vite: only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` or `VITE_` belong in the frontend, and those must never be secret keys.
*   Backend secrets are accessed via `process.env.VAR_NAME` only and are never returned to the client in API responses.
*   Generate a `.env.example` file with all required variable names but empty values.
*   If a secret must be used client-side (for example a Stripe publishable key), add a comment explaining it is a public key intentionally exposed.

```javascript
# Correct
const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);

# Wrong — never do this
const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_live_abc123...');
```


## 2. Rate Limiting

Every public-facing endpoint needs rate limiting. Without it, someone can hammer your auth routes, run up your AI costs, or flood your upload endpoint until your server falls over.

**RULE**  Apply rate limiting on all API routes

*   Auth endpoints (login, register, password reset): 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
*   General API: 60 requests per minute per IP.
*   AI and LLM proxy endpoints: 10 requests per minute per user.
*   File uploads: 5 requests per minute per IP.
*   Always return `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header when limits are hit.
*   Never silently swallow rate limit errors on the frontend. Show the user a clear message.

**Recommended libraries by stack:**
*   Node / Express: `express-rate-limit`
*   Next.js: `next-rate-limit` or middleware with `lru-cache`
*   Python / FastAPI: `slowapi`
*   Python / Flask: `Flask-Limiter`
*   Edge / Vercel: KV-based counters or Upstash Redis

```javascript
// Express rate limiting
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({ windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, max: 100 });
app.use('/api/', limiter);
```


## 3. Input Validation and Sanitization

Never trust user input. This is not a suggestion. Client-side validation is a UX convenience, not a security measure. Everything that matters happens on the server.

**RULE**  Validate and sanitize everything on the server

*   Use schema validation libraries: Zod or Joi for JS/TS, Pydantic for Python.
*   Sanitize all string inputs before storing or displaying them to prevent XSS.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORM methods. Never interpolate user input into raw SQL or NoSQL queries.
*   Validate data type, length limits, allowed characters, required fields, and enum values.
*   For file uploads: validate MIME type, file extension, and file size on the server.
*   Reject invalid input with a clear `400 Bad Request` response and log the attempt.

```javascript
// Zod schema validation
import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email().max(254),
  message: z.string().min(1).max(1000).trim(),
});

const result = schema.safeParse(req.body);
if (!result.success) return res.status(400).json({ error: result.error });
```


## 4. Authentication and Authorization

Auth is where most apps fail. Rolling your own from scratch is almost always a mistake. Use established libraries, follow the rules below, and check both identity and permissions on every request.

**RULE**  Use established auth libraries and follow password rules

*   Recommended options: NextAuth.js, Clerk, Supabase Auth, Auth0, Passport.js, lucia-auth.
*   Passwords must never be stored in plain text. Use bcrypt (minimum cost 12) or argon2.
*   JWTs must be signed with a strong secret stored in env (minimum 32 characters). Set short expiry of 15 to 60 minutes.
*   Refresh tokens must be stored in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage.
*   Verify the user identity and their permission to access the resource on every request.
*   Implement account lockout after repeated failed login attempts.
*   Add explicit role and permission checks on admin routes and sensitive operations.

```javascript
// Always check ownership, not just authentication
const post = await db.post.findUnique({ where: { id } });

if (!post || post.authorId !== session.user.id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}
```


## 5. SQL and Database Security

SQL injection is one of the oldest attacks around and it still works because AI-generated code will happily concatenate user input into a query if you let it.

**RULE**  Always use an ORM or parameterized queries

*   Use Prisma, Drizzle, SQLAlchemy, or Mongoose. Never construct queries via string concatenation with user data.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege: the database user should only have the permissions it actually needs.
*   Sanitize and validate all fields before any database write.
*   Never return raw database errors to the client. They leak schema information.

```javascript
// Safe parameterized query
const user = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', [email]);

// Never do this
const user = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`);
```


## 6. CORS Configuration

Wildcard CORS in production means any website can make requests to your API on behalf of your users. Lock it down to origins you actually control.

**RULE**  Never use wildcard CORS in production

*   Explicitly whitelist only the origins that should access your API.
*   Restrict allowed HTTP methods to only what each endpoint needs.
*   Use the credentials flag only when your app requires it.

```javascript
// Explicit CORS
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGIN,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
  credentials: true,
}));
```


## 7. HTTP Security Headers

Security headers are free protection. Most apps ship without them. A few lines of config can stop entire categories of attacks.

**RULE**  Always set security headers using helmet or equivalent

*   `Content-Security-Policy`: restrict script and style sources.
*   `X-Frame-Options`: DENY to prevent clickjacking.
*   `X-Content-Type-Options`: nosniff.
*   `Strict-Transport-Security` to force HTTPS.
*   `Referrer-Policy`: strict-origin-when-cross-origin.
*   Remove the `X-Powered-By` header to avoid leaking framework information.


## 8. File Upload Security

File uploads are a common attack surface. Validate everything on the server, store files safely, and never trust what the client tells you about the file.

**RULE**  Validate, rename, and store uploads safely

*   Validate file type by MIME type and extension on the server. Never trust the client.
*   Set strict file size limits: 5MB for images, 25MB for documents as a reasonable default.
*   Store uploaded files outside the web root or in a cloud bucket like S3, GCS, or Cloudinary.
*   Never serve user-uploaded files with executable permissions.
*   Rename uploaded files to a UUID. Never use the original filename directly.
*   Scan for malware if handling sensitive or public uploads.


## 9. Error Handling and Logging

Stack traces in production responses are a gift to attackers. They tell them exactly where your code lives, what dependencies you use, and where the weak points are.

**RULE**  Never return internal errors to the client

*   Return generic error messages to users: "Something went wrong" is enough.
*   Log errors server-side with full context: timestamp, user ID if available, route, sanitized input.
*   Use a logging service in production: Sentry, Datadog, or Logtail all work well.
*   Use correct status codes: 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors. Do not use 500 for validation failures.


## 10. Dependency Security

Third-party packages are code you did not write running in your app. Audit them regularly and do not install anything you have not thought about.

**RULE**  Audit dependencies and pin versions in production

*   Run `npm audit` or `pip-audit` after installing packages. Fix high and critical issues.
*   Avoid packages that are unmaintained (no updates in two or more years for security-relevant libs).
*   Pin dependency versions in production using `package-lock.json` or `requirements.txt`.
*   Do not install packages with excessive permissions or suspicious install scripts without reviewing them.


## 11. XSS Prevention

Cross-site scripting happens when you render untrusted content as HTML. AI-generated React code often uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML without thinking about what goes into it.

**RULE**  Never render dynamic user content as raw HTML

*   Do not use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React unless the content is fully sanitized with DOMPurify.
*   Never use `eval()`, `new Function()`, or `innerHTML` with dynamic user content.
*   Avoid inline script tags. Move JS to external files to enable CSP enforcement.


## 12. Deployment Checklist

Before every deploy, run through this list. It takes two minutes and it catches the things that tend to slip through at the end of a build.

**Pre-deploy gate:**
*   [ ] `.env` is not committed to git
*   [ ] All secrets are set in the hosting platform environment variable config
*   [ ] Debug mode and development logging are off in production
*   [ ] Database is not publicly exposed
*   [ ] HTTPS is enforced
*   [ ] Rate limiting is active on all public endpoints
*   [ ] CORS is restricted to known origins
*   [ ] Unused API routes are removed or protected


## AI and LLM-Specific Rules

If your app uses an AI API, there is an extra set of concerns on top of the standard list. Prompt injection, cost attacks, and insecure rendering are all real problems in production AI apps.

**RULE**  Treat LLM inputs and outputs like untrusted data

*   Never send raw user input directly to an LLM. Sanitize it first to prevent prompt injection.
*   Always set a `max_tokens` limit on LLM calls to prevent runaway costs.
*   Store the API key server-side only. Route all LLM calls through your own backend, never from the browser.
*   Log LLM usage (token counts) per user so you can detect abuse early.
*   Implement per-user or per-session token budgets to prevent cost attacks.
*   Validate and sanitize LLM output before rendering it in the UI. Generated HTML is an XSS risk.
